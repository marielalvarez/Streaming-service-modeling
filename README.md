# Streaming Service Modeling
Utilized Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, such as inheritance, to establish base and derived classes for video types, implemented polymorphism to manage various forms of video content, and applied operator overloading to facilitate the comparison and display of ratings. This content provider is designed to handle two categories of videos: Movies and Series. Each video will encompass key details, including an ID, title, duration, and genre (e.g., drama, action, mystery).
